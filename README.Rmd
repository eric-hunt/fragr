## Overview

`fragr` is an R package explicitly for wrangling capillary electrophoresis data that has been called in and exported from PeakScanner.

* `read_PeakScanner()` imports csv-format PeakScanner *combined table* files into a list
* `subfix()` repairs instances where the substrate peak is called twice (or more) from shoulders
* `prodify()` frames relative peak area in terms of product peak area only
* `act_specific()` defines specific activity
* `act_offsense()` defines all other activity on the same strand
* `act_offanti()` for two-dye experiments, defines activity on the opposite strand
